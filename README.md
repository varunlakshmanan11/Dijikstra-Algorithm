## Dijkstra Algorithm for Point Robot

Implemented Dijkstra Algorithm for a Point robot for coursework project
Instructions to run the code:
- Install VScode on your system.
- Install OpenCV libraries.
- Install matplot libraries.
- Install numpy libraries.  
- Just click on the run button to run the code
- Give inputs in the format x y (no commas, only space is required).
- Video will be generated in name dijkstra_varun_lakshmanan.
- The Runtime is in the range (18 - 25 seconds).
- The output video file will show the node exploration and the optimal
path.
- The nodes i used are given below:
    - node_initial = 20 20
    - node_goal = 1180 480
- The y coordinate will flip to match the required origin.
